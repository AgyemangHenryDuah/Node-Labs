# Node.js Backend Specialization Labs

This repository contains lab sessions from my backend specialization in Node.js. Each lab focuses on different aspects of backend development, providing hands-on experience with concepts such as RESTful APIs, microservices, authentication, database integration, error handling, and asynchronous programming.

## 📁 Repository Structure

Each week's lab is organized in its own folder with the following structure:

```plaintext
